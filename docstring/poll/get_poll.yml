description: Gets all data the LCP has about itself and its environment.
  Gets all data the LCP has, specially to the Context Broker, so the CB can integrate this data
  in its knownledge base. The Context Broker will be the one to call this method since there is
  no pushing information to the CB from the LCP. This is so mainly for security reasons.
